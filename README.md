# Applied Econometrics & Marketing Analytics in Python

This repository contains a curated set of **Jupyter Notebooks** demonstrating advanced econometric and statistical methods for marketing analytics, forecasting, and consumer modeling. Each notebook includes:

- **When to Use / Best Applications / When Not to Use** â€” practical guidance.  
- **How to Interpret Results** â€” key takeaways for decision-making.  
- **Fully coded Python examples** using open or simulated datasets.
